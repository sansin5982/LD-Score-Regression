# Linkage Disequilibrium

Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) is the **non-random association** of alleles
at two (or more) loci. In simpler words:

-   If knowing the allele at SNP1 gives you information about what
    allele is likely at SNP2 → these SNPs are in LD.
-   If the alleles are inherited completely independently → they are in
    **linkage equilibrium**.

### Why LD happens:

-   **Physical proximity** on a chromosome → closer SNPs tend to be
    inherited together.
-   **Population history** (bottlenecks, admixture).
-   **Selection** (certain combinations of alleles are advantageous).
-   **Genetic drift**

### Measures of LD:

-   **D′** (scaled measure of disequilibrium)
-   **r²** (squared correlation between alleles; common in GWAS)

#### Example:

If A-T combination occurs more often than expected by chance for SNP1
(A/G) and SNP2 (T/C), they are in LD.
